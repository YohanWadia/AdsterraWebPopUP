# AdsterraWebPopUP

tHIS  was only to make sure that i could do the following in FLUTTER
-initiate a popup at initState
-be able to keep/change the alret dialogs state once something happens
-use a loadingbuilder inside a FutureBuilder
-know when the Img from Firebase Storage was fully loaded into the ImgView Widget
-call a Future.Delay to setState after the builder is finished, to avoid building errors & an infinite loop
